# ogf-tools-for-overpass

Included are some tools (mostly bash scripts) to support 
deployment of the overpass api for [opengeofiction.net](https://opengeofiction.net/about).

Since overpass api is not available in github form, the INSTALL.md document can be 
used to install overpass, and some of the scripts included here are used to 
supplement or replace the default scripts.
